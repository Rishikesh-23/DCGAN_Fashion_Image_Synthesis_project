## **Introduction**

This project focuses on generating synthetic images of fashion items using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs). The generator network creates images, while the discriminator network distinguishes between real and fake images, improving the quality of generated images through adversarial training.

**Key Objectives**:
- Generate high-quality synthetic images of fashion items like shoes, dresses, and shirts.
- Demonstrate the capabilities of adversarial training using GANs.
- Visualize the progression of generated images over epochs.
